    <p>
    <h3>Baki Hanma (範馬 刃牙, Hanma Baki) is the protagonist of the Baki the Grappler franchise. At thirteen, he decided to
        take his training into his own hands to perform more intense training in his father's footsteps. He later aims
        to defeat him. Baki first fought in the no-rules arena at fifteen and went on to become its champion. He is the
        son of Yuujirou Hanma and Emi Akezawa and the half-brother of Jack Hanma.

        He is known as the "Champion" (チャンピオン, Chanpion) of the Underground Arena in Tokyo Dome. In the fourth manga
        series, he is often called "the Strongest Boy on the Earth" (地上最強のガキ, Chijō Saikyō no Gaki).</h3>

    <h1>
        <p><ins>Kakashi Hatake</ins></p>
    </h1>
    <p>
    <h3>Kakashi Hatake (はたけカカシ, Hatake Kakashi) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Hatake clan. Famed as Kakashi of the
        Sharingan (写輪眼のカカシ, Sharingan no Kakashi) and the Copy Ninja (コピー忍者, Kopī Ninja), he is one of Konoha's most
        talented ninja, regularly looked to for advice and leadership despite his personal dislike of responsibility. To
        his students on Team 7, Kakashi emphasises the importance of teamwork; he himself received this lesson, along
        with the Sharingan, from his childhood friend, Obito Uchiha. After the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi becomes
        Konoha's Sixth Hokage (六代目火影, Rokudaime Hokage, literally meaning: Sixth Fire Shadow).</h3>

    <h1>
        <p><ins>Power</ins></p>
    </h1>
    <p>
    <h3>Power possesses the corpse of an unknown woman or girl with long hair. She mainly appears being blonde. Her hair
        color varies from blonde to pink in manga illustrations, even appearing dirty blonde in some official art, and
        appears strawberry blonde in the anime. As a Fiend, she has red and yellow eyes that form a cross pattern, sharp
        teeth with defined fangs, and light red horns protruding from the top of her head.[3] If Power accumulates too
        much blood, her horns become larger and more curved, and she can sprout additional pairs of horns from the sides
        of her head.></h3>

    <p>
    <h3> "Your necessary evil is just an excuse to justify your own crimes. Those excuses are unnecessary to society.
        The
        truly necessary evils are always kept collared and controlled by the state."

        "I want to use Chainsaw Man to create a better world." ― Makima explaining her goals to Kishibe

        "Any source of happiness you experience? I'll be the one to create and destroy it all. You helped me kill Power.
        There might have been a way for you to save Hayakawa, but you killed him too. You even murdered your own father.
        Someone like you has no right to wish for a normal life, do they?" ― Makima trying to break Denji</h3>
